# Burgerlicious App

## Overview ##

Burgerlicious! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
